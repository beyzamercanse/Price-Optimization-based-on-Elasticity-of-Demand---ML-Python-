# Price Optimization based on Elasticity of Demand (ML/Python)

# (Retail Price Optimization Project)

## Overview

Welcome to the Retail Price Optimization project, meticulously crafted by **Beyza Mercan**. This initiative delves into the intricate landscape of retail pricing, utilizing advanced data analytics and machine learning to revolutionize how businesses set product prices.

## Project Highlights

### Problem Statement

In the dynamic world of retail, finding the optimal balance between attracting customers and ensuring profitability is an ongoing challenge. This project seeks to tackle this challenge head-on by developing an intelligent, data-driven system capable of dynamically optimizing product prices.

### Key Features

- **Holistic Data Collection:** Our project involves comprehensive data collection, spanning historical sales data, customer behavior metrics, and other pertinent information crucial for robust analysis.

- **Sophisticated Data Exploration:** We perform a deep dive into the data through exploratory data analysis, extracting nuanced insights, identifying patterns, and decoding customer preferences.

- **Cutting-edge Price Optimization Models:** Through the implementation of advanced machine learning models, we predict customer behavior and fine-tune product prices based on factors such as demand fluctuations, seasonal variations, and competitive pricing dynamics.

- **Intuitive User Interface (UI):** We've developed an intuitive UI to visualize pricing recommendations, providing a user-friendly platform for stakeholders to interact seamlessly with the system.
